# Udacity_Intro_to_Self_driving_Cars
Welcome to my respository which I created during my work on Udacity's Intro to Self Driving Cars Nanodegree. Here below is an overview of all the interesting projectscompleted by me during the course in C++ and Python.


## Project 1: Joy Ride - Bayesian Thinking

### Project Overview
This is a quick, simple project that gives you a chance to write code that controls a simulated car as you get familiar with the Workspaces you'll be using throughout this Nanodegree program. This project has three parts (but you will only submit part three).

### Part One 
Drag Race: In this part, you'll write code that lets a car jump over a grove of trees. This might not be a common scenario for a self-driving car, but it will get you familiar with the programming interface.
### Part Two
Circular Track: In this part, you'll write code that lets a car navigate a circular track. In doing so you'll explore the relationship between steering angle and turning radius.
### Part Three 
Parallel Park: In this part, you'll write a sequence of instructions that successfully parallel parks a car. In a real car, you obviously wouldn't be able to try repeatedly and hit other cars while you perfect your parking, but in this project, you can try as many times as you need to!

## Project 2 Implement a matrix class
In this project I practiced using my object oriented programming and matrix math skills by filling out the methods in a partially-completed `Matrix` class.

## Project 3 Translate Python to C++

The goal of this project is to take the python code you wrote when you implemented the two dimensional histogram filter and translate it into C++.

After you review the Python code you will download some starter C++ code. Your job is to complete the functions marked with TODO comments until the histogram filter works as expected!

You can evaluate the correctness of your code by compiling tests.cpp and then running the output. Do this by running the following from the command line.

g++ tests.cpp
./a.out
Evaluation
Once you have completed your project, use the Project Rubric to review the project. If you have covered all of the points in the rubric, then you are ready to submit! If you see room for improvement in any category in which you do not meet specifications, keep working!

Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity reviewer according to the same Project Rubric. Your project must "meet specifications" in each category in order for your submission to pass.

## Project 4 Implement a Route Planner
In this project, I built a route-planning algorithm like the one used in Google Maps to calculate the shortest path between two points on a map.
The black and yellow colored dots are the two given points and the algorithm was responsible to find the shortest path between them. Just like Google Maps!
It was the A* Algorithm in practice.

## Project 5 
In this project I built an image classifier from scratch. At the end of the project, it was an algorithm that can reliably classify an image as “pedestrian” or “car".
